One of the many ways to look for Exploit Kit/drive-by behavior. By default, this script looks for
a common exploit type: Java JAR (zip), Java Applet, or PDF that precedes a DOS executable. The 
behavior is tracked by source IP and a 2min window is allowed for an exploit type and exec to be
seen. Additionally, all DOS executables downloaded via HTTP with a User-Agent that contains 'Java/'
will be flagged.

Notices are generated for the suspicious file combination, and for the JVM downloading executable
content.
